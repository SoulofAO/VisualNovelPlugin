# VisualNovelPlugin
 It's just an abstract and easily expandable craft for dialogues of any kind in visual novels and just in dialogues. No more, no less. 

In order to use the plugin, install World Settings and Gamemode the same as in the Gamecore folder.
You can see an example of the dialog in the Test Scenario.

The plugin has not been tested for full functionality.
